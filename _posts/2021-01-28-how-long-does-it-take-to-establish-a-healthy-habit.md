Good habits can improve long-term health. However, it can be challenging to stick to new habits in the short-term. Plenty of New Year&#8217;s resolutions fizzle out by February.

Fortunately, a good amount of research has been done on habit formation. It appears to take around <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 weeks</a> (on average) for a new, healthy habit to become automatic. There is some variation due to how complex the habit is and when it is performed.

A simple <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3505409/pdf/bjgp62-664.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">template</a> has been developed to help establish new habits:

#### Make a new healthy habit {#__sec5title}

<ol class="is-style-tw-table">
  <li>
    Decide on a goal that you would like to achieve for your health.
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose a simple action that will get you towards your goal which you can do on a daily basis.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan when and where you will do your chosen action. Be consistent: choose a time and place that you encounter every day of the week.
  </li>
  <li>
    Every time you encounter that time and place, do the action.
  </li>
  <li>
    It will get easier with time, and within 10 weeks you should find you are doing it automatically without even having to think about it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Congratulations, youâ€™ve made a healthy habit!
  </li>
