I&#8217;m reading an interesting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Reading-News-Manifesto-Happier/dp/1529342724/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a>, &#8220;Stop Reading The News&#8221; by Rolf Dobelli.

The book makes a number of persuasive arguments why people should stop reading the news on a regular basis.

The book also challenges readers to go 30 days without news to break the habit. I'm game for the challenge.

I&#8217;m already 4 days in, and so far it does seem to be a beneficial change.
