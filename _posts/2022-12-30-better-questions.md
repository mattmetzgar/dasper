A lot of health indicators gravitate towards performance measures:

* How fast can you run a certain distance?
* How many minutes do you exercise?
* How much weight can you lift?
* How many calories do you consume?



Instead, I think there are much better measures of health you can measure on a day-to-day basis:

* How do you feel when you wake up in the morning?
* How do you feel when performing daily movements (picking up things, etc.)?
* Howâ€™s your posture throughout the day?
* How do you feel after exercising?
* How do you feel after eating a meal?

In my view, these are more important measures for sustaining long-term health and performance.
