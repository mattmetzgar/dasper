T﻿here seems to be a growing trend of former Navy Seals who are now writing books, giving talks, etc.

I﻿'ve read a few of these books this year, and I have to say they have not been good.  Here's what I think is happening:

N﻿avy Seal training is devised to produce the best soldiers.  However, being the best soldier does not mean a person has great knowledge that can be applied to other areas.  Just as if a person is a great actor or a great chemist - it doesn't mean their expertise spills over into other areas.

A large part of the Navy Seals training is the ability to absorb physical punishment.  What I don't like is how this gets carried over to exercise philosophy.

P﻿unishing yourself physically is not a great long-term strategy for health.  I'm active every day and in no way is this a "punishment".

I﻿n my view, it's actually the opposite: movement is a gift.  With the aging process, you never know how long your physical capabilities will hold up. 

I﻿'m looking to move and enjoy the gift of exercise as long as I can.
