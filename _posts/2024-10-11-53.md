I﻿ turned 53 last week.  I am still holding up pretty good physically, knock on wood.  I am still doing distance running, sprinting, playing ultimate frisbee, and playing competitive soccer.

I﻿ had plantar fasciitis for a few months last year (which really sucked), but I'm back to full capabilities.  

I﻿ really enjoy all the physical activity and hope to continue for many more years.
