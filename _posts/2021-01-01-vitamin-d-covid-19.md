What if a cheap supplement could help protect you from COVID-19? Vitamin D may very well improve outcomes associated with COVID-19.

There have been a number of studies showing a link between Vitamin D and COVID-19. For example, this&nbsp;[study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33146028/)&nbsp;shows how low Vitamin D levels are associated with increased COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality.

In terms of cause-and-effect, this&nbsp;[study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7456194/pdf/main.pdf)&nbsp;showed positive results from Vitamin D supplementation. This [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.16.20232397v1) showed no effect. Other, larger randomized studies are underway.

Unfortunately, some government bodies are taking a wait-and-see approach, citing there is “[insufficient evidence](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/942809)” for Vitamin D supplementation at the present time.

Why, in the midst of a pandemic, would anyone want to wait for that evidence given that Vitamin D is an extremely safe supplement? There is a high potential upside with virtually no risk.

This idea was recently&nbsp;[summarized](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201912)&nbsp;by a group of researchers:

“There seems nothing to lose and potentially much to gain by recommending vitamin D supplementation for all, e.g. at 800–1000 IU/day, making it clear that this is to help ensure immune health and not solely for bone and muscle health.”

Personally, I take 4,000 IU of Vitamin D per day (this [brand](https://www.amazon.com/Carlson-Immune-Health-Strength-Unflavored/dp/B06XSKFSVV/)). More information about Vitamin D is available [here](https://www.vitamindsociety.org/).
