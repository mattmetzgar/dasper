It's amazing how much the blogging world has changed over the past ten years.  While blogs used to hold the majority of the conversations, now they do not.  I often see the websites of best-selling authors that have zero comments on their blogs.

Of course, all the conversations have moved to social media.  My issue is that these companies are disproportionally benefiting from this arrangement.  The participants are the ones creating the conversations and potentially creating value.  The companies profit from this while the participants make nothing.

Twitter is nothing more than a website - a large server.  The main reason they're successful is they have created a critical mass and achieved a network effort.  I'm sure someone could build a clone of Twitter in a short period of time.  For such an unremarkable product, the economic gains seem outsized.

I hope that online conversations will eventually shift back to decentralized platforms.
